# Interactive Dashboard for COVID-19 Analysis

---

## Dataset Used
- [Covid-19 Gender Data](https://github.com/12narendra45/Data_Visulization-DashBoard/blob/main/dashboardtab_updated_with_gender.csv)

---

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to explore and visualize COVID-19 data trends. The dashboard provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface to analyze global and regional statistics, including gender-based mortality insights.

---

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Questions
This dashboard is designed to help users answer critical questions, such as:
1. **Global Trends**:
   - What is the total number of confirmed, active, recovered, and death cases globally and regionally?
   - Which regions have the highest or lowest recovery and death rates?
2. **Temporal Insights**:
   - How do new cases, recoveries, and deaths trend over time?
   - Are there specific periods with notable spikes in cases or mortality rates?
3. **Gender-Specific Analysis**:
   - In which regions is male or female mortality higher?
   - How does gender-based mortality compare across different time periods and regions?
4. **Country Comparisons**:
   - Which countries have the highest case fatality rate or recovery rates?
   - How does the number of active cases vary by country?

## Features
### Dashboard Highlights:
- **Global Trends**: Visualizations of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide.
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: Insights into regions where male or female mortality is predominant.
- **Dynamic Filters**: 
  - Filter by `Date`, `WHO Region`, or `Country/Region` to narrow the analysis.
- **Calculated Indicators**:
  - Recovery rates, fatality rates, and deaths per recovered cases.

### Interactive Components:
- KPI values of new cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Heatmaps for geographic trends.
- Line charts for temporal analysis.
- Bar charts for country-wise comparisons.
- Exportable views and dynamic slicers for specific datasets.
- Map Chart for country-wise new cases.

## Overall Analysis
### Key Insights from the Dataset:
1. **Global Statistics**:
   - Highest number of confirmed cases in a single record: **16.48 million**.
   - Death rates range from **2.04% to 7.18%**, with a global average of **4.86%**.
2. **Gender-Specific Observations**:
   - Higher female mortality in **54% of the dataset** entries.
   - Male mortality dominates in some regions, including Europe and the Americas.
3. **Regional Trends**:
   - **Europe** records the most frequent entries, followed by **Africa** and **Eastern Mediterranean**.
   - Significant variations in recovery rates, with some regions achieving up to **57.45% recovery per 100 cases**.
4. **Temporal Trends**:
   - Surge in new cases and deaths correlates with specific periods (e.g., mid-year spikes).
